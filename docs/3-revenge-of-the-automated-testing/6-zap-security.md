### OWASP ZAP Vulnerability Scanning
> what is it why important

For this exercise, we will use a tool called "OWASP Zed Attack Proxy" or ZAP in short.  It helps automatically find security vulnerabilities in your applications. This allows the developers to automate penetration testing and security regression testing of the application in the CI/CD pipeline.
