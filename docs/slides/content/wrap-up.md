### Team WtW 
In your table groups, run a mini Walk the Walls session just like we did each morning. Pick the practices you've created throughout the week and discuss them in your teams.



### Mini Big Picture üöÇüöÇ
With only the items in the bags given to you by your instructor, recreate as many elements on the Big Picture as you can. You get one point for every item on the Big Picture. <!--{.element: style="font-size: smaller; font-weight: 400;"} -->

# Let's Recap



### What did we do?
* Team Forming
* Discovery, Delivery, Foundational practices
* Hands-on technical exercises
* Built two visualizations useful for any project
  * Practice Corner
  * The Big Picture




### Delivery Showcase & Demo Day



### The Showcase
#### _What is it?_
* An event where stakeholders and interested parties are given a demonstration of
recent work performed by a team
* The latest increment of the product with new features built by the team is
showcased
* Provides an opportunity to review culture and practices used by the team
* It is often performed at the end of an iteration but can be performed at key
milestones in the life of the product



### The Showcase
#### _Why use it?_
The showcase provides a critical feedback loop for products being incrementally
and iteratively built. Stakeholders can give feedback on the features as they
are being built, suggest improvements, give ideas for new features, and catch
problems early. <!--{.element: style="font-size: smaller; font-weight: 400;"} -->

#### _Other benefits_
* Provides an open forum for channeling feedback from stakeholders to product
leadership so that prioritization and future work can be adapted accordingly
* Enables collaboration across all interested parties on a regular basis



### Demo Day
#### _What is Demo Day about?_
* Demo Day is the culmination of a trip around the Practice Loop
* It is an opportunity for the team to showcase their work from a particular
time period
* An opportunity for key stakeholders to see the results
* May have had many showcases or product increments completed feeding this
* An opportunity to talk about "what's next" and how do to adapt the culture for
the next round
* An opportunity to celebrate!



### Demo Day
#### _Tips_
* "Show" NOT "tell"
* Take the opportunity to drive excitement around the product **and** culture
* The demo should include not just the product of a sprint or release but of
the **culture** and **philosophy** used to produce it




### Choose your own adventure - Exercise A or B



### Exercise A: The Successful Demo Day 
#### In teams, take some time to brainstorm:
* What have you taken away from this week's set of sessions and activities:
  * People, processes **and** technology
* What did you learn about your team, class, or instructors?
* What did you enjoy?



### Exercise B: The Success Factors and the Anti Patterns
#### In teams, take some time to brainstorm:
* Demo Day - What are the things you would bring and show during a Demo Day?
* Success Factors - What are things or people who could help drive this new way of working and help with adoption
* Anti Patterns - What are the things that would hinder us or prevent us from succeeding? 



### Closing
* Closing comments round
* High Five
* CSAT
* SWAG
* Sharing social contacts



### Call to Action
* Use what you have learned
* Reach out to your classmates and instructors
* Use the resources shared during the class
* Get yourself a copy of `DevOps Culture and Practice with OpenShift` üí∞üí∞



#### üìóüêõ Get yourself a copy of our Bookie Wookie üç™üç™
