## Impact Mapping



### Impact Mapping
#### _What is It?_
Impact Mapping is an engaging, graphical, and strategic planning technique.

At the end of the impact map, you should have:
* A shared understanding of your project's goal or problem statement
* An inventory of human behavioral changes (impacts) that must occur (or not occur)
for your project to be successful
* Optionally, an inventory of project scope that could be delivered to achieve
the aforementioned impacts
* Some sort of prioritization of scope and/or impacts



### Impact Mapping
It was brought to the IT world by Gojko Adzic in 2012.

### Impact Mapping
#### _Why Use It?_
* Focuses on business objectives
* Re-orients us towards delivering value, not delivering features
* Introduces a very simple human centered design process
* It is a graphical mind map
  * Reduces the barrier to entry for participants and facilitators
* The technique is highly adaptable for time and audience
* Helps identify which hypotheses are the most valuable to test

### Exercise - Setting the Scene
#### Pet Battle Industries
A silly app that allows users to upload pictures of their üêà or üêï and enter them into a competition.
* Started as a hobbyist application built by a few friends over a weekend
* Deployed as a single VM running on a free host. Over the weekend a famous person tweeted about the app and it exploded in usage however the application started to fail and crash loads under the load
* The team behind the hobbyist app have decided to quit their jobs and go all in on PBI&trade;


### Exercise - Impact Mapping 1/2
As a class:

1. Start at the end:
   * We have an easy to use tool with 1 million users getting tasks done.
2. Discuss:
   * Is this a good goal?
3. Diverge <> Converge:
   * Who are the **all** the actors that can get us to our goal?
   * Who are the focus ones? Pick one to two actors per table



### Exercise - Impact Mapping 2/2
As a class:
1. Walk through creating the Impacts and Deliverables for one Actor

As a team:
1. Determine impacts and deliverables for your actors
2. Issue your Donal Dollars&trade; to identify where you should place your bets
