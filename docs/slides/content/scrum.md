### Origins of Scrum
![Scrum](images/agile/scrum.jpg) <!-- {.element: class="inline-image"} -->
* Rugby term: used to restart play
* 1986 Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka published [The New New Product Development Game](https://hbr.org/1986/01/the-new-new-product-development-game)
* 1990 Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber used scrum for software development



### 3 Key Roles in Scrum
* **Product Owner** - Conveys the message of envisioned product and sets priorities for team
* **Scrum Master** - Coaches team on Scrum process and helps iterate towards a productive environment
* **Development Team Members** - Self-organize to transform backlog items into a potentially releasable product increment

| Scrum Event | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Sprint Planning** | Commit to a set of defined work as a team for the upcoming sprint cycle. The end result is the Sprint Backlog. |
| **Daily Standup** | Daily sync to share common understanding of the goals, coordinate the team effort, report on progress of work, and to communicate problems and improvements. |
| **Sprint Review** | Review what was completed during the sprint with all relevant stakeholders to collect feedback. |
| **Sprint Retrospective** | Help teams reflect on their internal team process with the goal to continuously improve. |
| **Sprint** | A time boxed event that brings the team towards the goal set for that iteration and ends with reviewing the product increment. |



### 3 Key Artifacts in Scrum
* **Product Backlog** - Set of all baseline requirements prioritized for the team
* **Sprint Backlog** - Subset of the Product Backlog the team agreed to pull into the Sprint to work on
* **Product Increment** - The most important artifact that is produced at the end of each Sprint



### Exercise - The Ball Game (Setup)

#### In Your Groups
1. Draw a table with two columns and three rows.
2. Record your estimate for an iteration.
3. Pass the balls for one minute.
4. Record the actual score.
5. Reflect on your group strategy.



### Exercise - The Ball Game 
#### Rules
1. Pass as many ping pong balls through all the team members.
2. There must be "air time" between each pass.
3. You cannot use any artificial containers.
4. If you drop a ball, you lose a point.
