### User Stories
As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >
#### As a learner, I want to stay awake so that I can be attentive and listen to teacher

User Story Mapping is an effective practice for creating lightweight release plans that can drive standard Agile delivery practices. At the end of user story mapping, you should have:

User Story Mapping

* Frame the opportunity, goal, outcome, and value
* Tell the story of the product from left to right (user steps)
* Go back and talk about and capture the details of each step
* Use value driven outcomes to slice out valuable release plans

#### Value Slicing
_The goal of value slicing is to divide user stories into iterations such that it forms the outline of a plan. Usually the first iteration builds a minimally viable product._



#### Product Slicing Gone Bad!
![Example1](images/user-story-mapping-and-value-slicing/slicing-gone-wrong.jpg)



#### _Why use it?_
* No one likes estimating work effort, but it's an important step in many environments. User Story Mapping presents an approach to estimation that many teams find much more tolerable than practices like planning poker or t-shirt sizing
* Many projects have a natural progression of work from beginning, middle to end. This progression is often lost in a traditional flat backlog. User Story Mapping captures this information with a lightweight mechanism to plan out more than one iteration (i.e. an Agile release plan)
* User Story Mapping presents backlog items in the context of the overall business process so you don't lose sight of "the big picture", a common pitfall in Scrum projects




#### _How do we use it?_
![how-to-use](images/user-story-mapping-and-value-slicing/how-to-use.png)<!-- {.element: class="" style="border:none; box-shadow:none; max-width:30%; float:right;" } -->
1) Follow the **INVEST** guidelines for good user stories
2) Individually capture, using stickies everything you do in the process you are mapping and add all activities to the story map. Visualise everything
3) Identify and remove duplicates
4) Cluster similar activities and capture a theme title
5) Slice out high value to form incremental release strategy. Filter and maintain focus on delivering valuable outcomes

### Class Exercise

_What are all the activities you do to in the morning to prepare for work and get there on time?_

1. As an individual, capture on individual stickies all the things you do from the moment you wake up until you arrive at work<!-- {.element: class="fragment"  data-fragment-index="1"} -->
2. As a team, add all activities to the story map and remove duplicates. If some are similar but slightly different, do not remove as duplicates<!-- {.element: class="fragment"  data-fragment-index="2"} -->
3. Cluster similar activities and capture themes above them e.g. Cleaning Routine<!-- {.element: class="fragment"  data-fragment-index="3"} -->



### Class Exercise üõè ‚è∞

_Oh no! You slept through your alarm and woke up... now you must get to a big meeting at work that you cannot miss. What  activities **must** you do to prepare for work and get there on time?  You cannot join remotely!_

1. As a team, draw a line on the user story mapping board representing what
must be done<!-- {.element: class="fragment"  data-fragment-index="1"} -->
2. Discuss which stories are absolutely necessary given the scenario üõè ‚è∞ <!-- {.element: class="fragment"  data-fragment-index="2"} -->
3. Move stories below the line that are not absolutely necessary based on
consensus of the team<!-- {.element: class="fragment"  data-fragment-index="3"} -->

### Facilitation Tips
![slicing-summary](images/user-story-mapping-and-value-slicing/summary.png)<!-- {.element: class="inline-image" } -->
</br>
* A single slice doesn't mean in scope and out of scope
* Same slice size doesn't mean each slice is the goal of a sprint
* If possible add target outcomes as grouping for the Value slice, it gives the benefit to be linked to business goals
