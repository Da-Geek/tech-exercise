### The Three Ways of DevOps

### The Three Ways of DevOps
![first-way](images/what-is-devops/first-way.png)<!-- .element: class="image-no-shadow image-full-width " -->

The First Way emphasizes the performance of the entire system, as opposed to the performance of a specific silo of work or department. This can be as large as a division or as small as an individual contributor. <!-- {.element: class="medium para"} -->

### The Three Ways of DevOps
![second-way](images/what-is-devops/second-way.png)<!-- .element: class="image-no-shadow image-full-width " -->
* The Second Way is about creating more frequent feedback loops.

* The goal of almost any process improvement initiative is to shorten and amplify feedback loops so necessary corrections can be continually made.

* The outcomes of the Second Way include:
  * Understanding and responding to all customers, internal and external.
  * Shortening and amplifying all feedback loops
  * Embedding knowledge where we need it

### The Three Ways of DevOps
![third-way](images/what-is-devops/third-way.png)<!-- .element: class="image-no-shadow image-full-width " -->
* The Third Way is about creating a culture that fosters two things:
  * Continual experimentation, taking risks and learning from failure
  * Understanding that repetition and practice is the prerequisite to mastery

* Experimentation and taking risks are what ensures that we keep pushing to improve.

* The outcomes of the Third Way include:
  * Allocating time for the improvement of daily work
  * Creating rituals that reward the team for taking risks
  * Introducing faults into the system to increase resilience
