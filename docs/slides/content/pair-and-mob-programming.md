### Mob Programming in Action

### Pair Programming
![Pair Programming](images/pair-and-mob-programming/coaching-coders-coding.jpg) <!-- {.element: class="inline-image"} -->
</br>
</br>
**Pair programming** is a practice used in e**X**treme **P**rogramming in which
two programmers work together at one computer.



### Mob Programming
![Mob Programming](images/pair-and-mob-programming/chairs-developer-development.jpg) <!-- {.element: class="inline-image"} -->
</br>
**Mob programming** is a software development approach where the whole team
works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same
computer.



##### Why do it?
#### Pair Programming
* Enable knowledge sharing between team members.
* Increased quality of work as it is reviewed and improved simultaneously.
* Building of trust between team members.
</br>
</br>

#### Mob Programming
* Ensures the whole team understands how a specific feature is implemented or problem is solved. 
* It can also be a quick way to onboard new team members.



##### How do we do it?
#### Pair Programming
* The team member behind the keyboard and mouse is the driver. The driver is focused on performing the actual work.
* The other team member is the navigator or observer. The navigator is focused on the strategic outcome of the work being performed.
* The navigator reviews the work being performed by the driver as it is done.
* While reviewing, the navigator keeps in mind the end goal and ensures the current task is working towards it.
* Switch the roles often, for example every 15 minutes, for the team members to experience the different aspects of the work.



##### How do we do it?
#### Mob Programming
* Mob programming involves the whole team working on a single piece of functionality at the same time. The easiest way to mob program is to have one team member driving a laptop that is connected to a large screen or projector.
* The person behind the keyboard and mouse is usually called "Driver" and the others would be "Navigators". This role should be rotated if working on implementation.
* When using this practice for knowledge sharing then rotation is not necessary.
* The whole team then implement the feature together by talking through the development together.




### Class Exercise
‚è∞üé®üë®‚Äçüé®üñº



#### Individual Drawing

1. Everyone grab a small post-it.
2. Each person grab a different color pen.
3. Draw Steven Tyler on your own sticky note.



#### Pair Drawing

1. Assemble in pairs (or trios if there is an odd number).
2. Each pair grab a medium post-it.
3. Take turns drawing an element of Steven Tyler.



#### Mob Drawing

1. Assemble in table groups.
2. Each table use an easel post-it.
3. Take turns drawing an element of Steven Tyler.

##### Key Takeaways
- **Mentoring of team members:** Sharing tips and tricks or shortcuts can widen both pairs' skill depth. This sharing can also bring junior associates up to speed very rapidly.
- **Half the code:** Two minds working on the same problem makes for more efficiently written code, so less spaghetti.
- **No pull requests:** code is being reviewed as it's written avoiding superficial reviews. They won't cut corners when pairing as someone is watching.
- **Team bonding:** Pair and mob programming facilitates interactions. A room with mob and pair programming going on is louder. Happy coders lead to better code.



##### Key Takeaways
- **The knowledge stays in the team:**  when holidays or even flu season take over, the team can still continue to work at pace knowing the Unicorn is not leaving with key information.
