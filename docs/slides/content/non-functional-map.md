#### _What is it?_
A tool to capture and articulate the non-functional requirements of a solution that a team are striving to deliver

<!--  
#### _What is it?_
* Aims to elaborate non-functional areas that are unlikely to be captured using practices primarily focused on functional aspects of a solution.
* Non-functional requirements are broken down into areas represented by each segment on the canvas.
* Findings and learnings from other Discovery practices can be input into this practice if appropriate.
-->



#### Why do we use it?
* To gain a shared understanding of non-functional aspects of a system in a visually structured representation. 

* On completion you should have a good view on the key non-functional considerations for the solution and where work is required to realise these.

## How do we do it?
<!-- .slide: data-background-size="contain" data-background-image="https://openpracticelibrary.com/images/non-functional-requirements-map.jpg", class="black-style" -->



#### How do we do it?
1. Ensure that everyone participating is comfortable with the headings and what they mean <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. For each heading, capture on stickies important considerations or requirements for the system or solution. Depending on the number of participants, you could use facilitation techniques such as 1-2-4-all or splitting into smaller groups to capture items <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

3. For each heading, play back the stickies as a group  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
4. During the playback, think about whether each sticky should be:  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

### Class Exercise - Setting the Scene



#### Setting the Scene: Pet Battle Industries
Pet Battle Industries have a good handle on the functional design of their applications. Let's not think of all the _other_ things they need to do to harder their application.




### Create the NFR Map
#### *As a class:*

1. Ensure that everyone participating is comfortable with the headings and what they mean
2. Split the map into two segments and divide among the teams - each team taking at least one half of the map 
#### *In your team:*
3. For your area: for each heading, capture important considerations or requirements for the system or solution and add stickies for each item



# Exercise Wrap Up
#### *As a class:*
3. Merge the Map with all area
4. For each heading, play back the top two or three stickies as a group
5. During the playback, think about whether each sticky would update the DoD / ACs on a story or form an experiment for the sprint.
