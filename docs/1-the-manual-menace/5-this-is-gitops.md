### 5. Validate our GitOps

GitOps is a simple process of managing all of your systems, environments, and applications via Git. Git represents the single source of truth for all your applications, your tooling, and even
your clusters. Changes to any of these things can be pull requested and discussed before an automated process applies them.

1. Make a change in the UI and have it overwritten - GOOO GOOOO GITOPS ðŸ’ª
2. Make same change in UJ to have it persisted
   1. Add some env var to the Jenkins deployment
