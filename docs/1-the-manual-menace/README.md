## ðŸ¦† Conventions ðŸ¦†
When running through the exercise, we're tried to call out where things need replacing. The key ones are anything inside an `<>` should be replaced. For example, if your team is called `biscuits` then in the instructions if you see `<TEAM_NAME>` this should be replaced with `biscuits` like so:
```yaml
name: <TEAM_NAME>

# this becomes
name: biscuits
```
