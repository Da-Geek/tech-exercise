## Deploy PetBattle

[TODO] Little introduction to PetBattle


### 1. SealedSecrets 
* [copy + paste from previous ex]


### 2. Deploy supporting infra components for PetBattle
Deploy an piece of supporting tech or "infra" for PB - keycloak in `pet-battle/staging/values.yaml` && `pet-battle/test/values.yaml`


```yaml
applications:
  # Keycloak
  keycloak:
    name: keycloak
    enabled: true
    source: https://github.com/petbattle/pet-battle-infra.git
    source_path: 'keycloak'
    source_ref: main # helm chart version
    values:
      app_domain: apps.cluster.region.com
      operartor: false
```



### 3 - The Pipelines 

Split into groups and each group does
- we need to fork PetBattle (clone from GitHub and push to GitLab)
- Update Jenkinsfile / Tekton task to leave out some stuff for participants
- Add webhook into GitLab repositories for triggering jobs
- Update `pet-battle/staging/values.yaml` && `pet-battle/test/values.yaml` with services information. That's where two teams integrate their works.
- By updating version files (pom.xml etc), kick the pipelines
- Question: should we only leave 'master/main' branch deployment
[TODO] decide what to leave out from Jenkinsfile
